## Stack Implementation using List in Python

## Aim:
To implement a stack using Python's built-in list data structure and its methods append() and pop().

## Procedure:

1.Create an empty list to represent the stack.

2.Use the append() method to push three elements onto the stack.

3.Display the stack after the push operations.

4.Use the pop() method to remove three elements from the stack.

5.Display the stack after the pop operations.

## Program:
```
stack = []
stack.append(input())
stack.append(input())
stack.append(input())
print("Stack before elements are popped")
print(stack)
stack.pop()
stack.pop()
stack.pop()
print("\nStack after elements are popped:")
print(stack)


```

## Result:
Successfully implemented a stack using Python list. Items were added using append() and removed using pop(), demonstrating LIFO (Last In First Out) behavior of stack.
